## How to Make Audio and Video Examples at Harris Music Library
The Quiet Reading Room of the Harris Music Library at Haverford College features Mac workstations equiped to help you produce audio and video examples for your music scholarship projects.  The stations include the following software:

* Camtasia (for video and audio editing)
* Audio Hijack (to capture sound from any application)
* Fission (to edit sound clips)
* Reaper (also for sound editing)

These are not meant to replace production tools such as ProLogic.  But together these tools provide an easy path for making audio or video examples to accompany a paper or presentation, or ways to make high-quality video or audio podcasts that combine sounds, narration and moving or still images.

The stations also include DVD drives (so you can make examples from CD or DVD recordings), Rode USB microphones (for narration), and headphones (so you can monitor and review your work).

You will need to bring **your own USB drive**, or be ready to log into Gdrive or OneDrive remotely (via a browser) so that you can save your work. Don't expect to leave your work on the shared computer.

## Logging In

The workstations look like others on campus, with the usual log in.  Of course you are welcome to use these machines in the customary way with your Haverford or Bryn Mawr ID.  

But WAIT! You will be logging in differently if you want to use the software mentioned above.  Use the Course ID (like 'musc229') and the password provided by your instructor.
