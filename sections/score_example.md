### Score Examples

1. **Download a PDF from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/), **a free archive of scores mostly in the public domain. With the exception of those flagged as _Non-PD US_, you may use these editions in any way you like. Let's say you're writing about [the first volume of J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier](https://imslp.org/wiki/Das_wohltemperierte_Klavier_I,_BWV_846-869_(Bach,_Johann_Sebastian)). In the case of a well known work like this, there are many printed editions to choose from, even manuscripts. If you have questions, Haverford’s music librarian Guillermo Gómez (ggomez1@haverford.edu) will help you navigate results.

    **If the score you need is not available on IMSLP, get a hard copy from the library**. Guillermo can assist you. He can also advise you on copyright and usage. 

2. **Extract from, crop, and/or convert the PDF** (or scanned image) to include only the necessary content. 
3. **Add your example to your paper or WordPress site**, along with a caption that identifies the item and source:

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

        Example 1.  The opening five measures of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Prelude in C-major, from, _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_, ed. Carl Czerny, vol. 1 (Leipzig: Peters, 1863), 7. 

4. **Add a parenthetical reference to the example at the appropriate point in your essay**:

        The opening of Bach’s Prelude in C-major from _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ establishes the home key in only a few bars (Ex. 1).

5. **At the end of your essay, create a list of examples that provides citations**. Format score citations in the same manner as book citations, and use note format here. See the Music Dept. Style Sheet or ask the music librarian if you have questions about citation.
