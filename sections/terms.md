### Other Terminology

The names of major style periods are capitalized (Middle Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic). Most “-isms,” modernism included, are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> capitalized. The term “medieval” is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> capitalized. When referring to the tradition of Western art-music as a whole (rather than the eighteenth-century style period), the term “classical” is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> capitalized. Likewise, the terms “jazz” and “popular music” are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> capitalized.

Put dynamic indications like _pianissimo _and _forte_ in italics.

Do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> use italics for standard tempo designations like andante, moderato, allegro, and presto. The same goes for common Italian terms like legato, staccato, arpeggio, and crescendo. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Do</span> use italics for less common directions like _col legno _and _sotto voce_, and for French and German vocabulary.

Capitalize letters that specify pitches and keys. Do not use the number sign in place of a sharp sign or the letter b in place of a flat sign. Write these out.   

	Although the song is in G major, the singer begins on an E flat.  

As shown below in the section on hyphens, write sharp and flat keys like this: 

	C-sharp minor
	E-flat major 

When necessary use subscripts to specify the octave of a pitch. See Holoman for a comprehensive presentation of pitch-naming conventions.

Modern orchestras tune to an A<sub>4</sub>. C<sub>4</sub> is commonly known as middle C.  

The words “major” and “minor” are not capitalized unless they form part of a title. Do not use case to differentiate between major and minor. 

INCORRECT: Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony is in c minor.

CORRECT: Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony is in C minor.

Whenever possible, use phrases like “common time,” “triple meter,” and “duple meter” to avoid writing time signatures as fractions. 

Given the challenges of typing roman-numeral chords with figures, write out chord names.

	The accompaniment vacillates between a first-inversion tonic triad and a third-inversion dominant-seventh chord. 

Write out the word “measure” and numbers under 100 unless they are in parentheses.

	The oboe solo begins in measure twenty-six.
	The theme repeatedly leaps upward (mm. 2, 4, 6) before descending by step (m. 8).
