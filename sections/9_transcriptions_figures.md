### Original Transcriptions

Sometimes you might need to make an original transcription of a performance (recorded or live).  In that case you will need to:

1. **Export your transcription from the notation software**, saving it as a JPEG, TIFF, or PDF file. If you need assistance with Sibelius or other notation software, please contact Guillermo Gómez (ggomez1@haverford.edu).
2. **Label, store, and reference this file** in the same manner as a score example (see steps 3–8 above).

        To conclude the phrase, Rainey slides down from a blue note to the tonic (Ex. 1).

3. **Cite the source of your transcription in your list of examples**.

> 1. Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, “Blues the World Forgot,” Paramount, 1927, 0:55–1:05.  Original transcription by the author.

### Figures 

Figures include tables, diagrams, charts, and images (but **not score excerpts or transcriptions**, which are treated above). For images, you should seek out authorized images from museums or collections, such as those assembled on  [Named Link](https://www.artstor.org/ "ArtStor"), which is easily available via Tripod.  Diagrams, charts, or other custom markup can be created with Google Draw. 

Save your Figure in PNG format for use in Word, Google Docs, or WordPress.

Unless figures are prohibitively large, label them as follows and include them in the body of your essay. Note the use of boldface, and be sure to number figures separately from examples.

**For example:**
