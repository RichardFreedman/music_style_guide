### Citing Written Sources
We use the **Author-Date** system for referencing writings about music, scores, and other supporting evidence.  In it, You can read more about the system here on the [Chicago Manual of Style web resource.](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html)

It’s seldom necessary to clutter your narrative with titles and dates of scholarly works. It’s normally sufficient to name the author, relying on the subsequent Author-Date (plus page) reference to provide the remaining information.  Readers then turn to your bibliography of list of works cited to learn more about the details of the fact of publication.

For example, in the body of your argument you might write (the **BOLD** reference is just for emphasis):

    Carolyn Abbate has urged musicologists to consider the practical and corporeal dimensions of music (**Abbate 2004: 508**).

Notice that the author-date reference contains the _exact location of the material you are quoting_ or referring to. The bibliography is the place for the _full details about where to find this particular publication_.  In the author-date system: 

    Abbate, Carolyn. 2004. “Music—Drastic or Gnostic?” _Critical Inquiry _30, no. 3: 505-36.

Do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> include a URL or DOI for electronically accessed sources. Likewise, do <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> specify “print” or “electronic” in notes and bibliographies for music courses. See _[The Chicago Manual of Style Online](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) _for further guidance on all other matters pertaining to citation, and models for many different types of publications you will need to cite (books, chapters in books, journal articles, reference works, scores, primary sources, etc.)

### Citing Scores and Recordings

See the [Music Example Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1alBeVyXkABBwWlTiCMGBLB3hoO5f4sMm4wMnTVzDM4Y/edit) for guidance on Fair Use of copyrighted material.

**Scores are books**. Cite them accordingly.

Bibliography:

    	Liszt, Franz. 1978. _Années de pèlerinage: Première année, Suisse_._ _Munich: Henle Verlag.

**Audio and video recordings** require some special treatment:  publishers often obscure the date of the publication (since audiences sometimes want something “new”), and there often is no “place” of publication as in a book.  Finally, you will need to adapt these references according to the genre and type of music. A performance of a work by Bach might be listed under his name.  A jazz rendition of a popular tune would be listed under the names of the performers or ensemble. 	

For information about dates and performers, you can turn to the cover and notes to the item itself.  Sometimes digital resources.  [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/) is often a good way to find missing details.

**Audio recording** might look like this:

        Bach, Johann Sebastian. 2010. _St. Matthew Passion_. Collegium Vocale Gent. Philippe Herreweghe. With Ian Bostridge, Werner Güra, Susan Hamilton, et al. Harmonia Mundi, 3 compact discs.   

        Parker, Charlie. 1988. _Bird:  The Complete Verve Recordings (1946-54)_.  Verve. 

**Video recording** might look like this:

        Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus. 2015. _Die Entführung aus dem Serail_. François Roussillon, director. David McVicar, stage director. Robin Ticciati, conductor. Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. With Sally Matthews, Edgaras Montvidas, Tobias Kehrer, et al. Glyndebourne, 02:45:00.	

**Liner notes to recordings** are a special case, but are often worth citing for special insights about from the artists, or the nature of the project, or even for scholarly content:

        Marissen, Michael. 2010. Liner Notes to Accompany Johann Sebastian Bach,  _St.   Matthew Passion_. Collegium Vocale Gent. Philippe Herreweghe. With Ian Bostridge, Werner Güra, Susan Hamilton, et al. Harmonia Mundi..
