### Original Transcriptions

Sometimes you might need to make an original transcription of a performance (recorded or live).  In that case you will need to:

1. **Export your transcription from the notation software**, saving it as a JPEG, TIFF, or PDF file. If you need assistance with Sibelius or other notation software, please contact Guillermo Gómez (ggomez1@haverford.edu).
2. **Label, store, and reference this file** in the same manner as a score example (see steps 3–8 above).

        To conclude the phrase, Rainey slides down from a blue note to the tonic (Ex. 1).

3. **Cite the source of your transcription in your list of examples**.

    List of Examples

    1. Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, “Blues the World Forgot,” Paramount, 1927, 0:55–1:05.  Original transcription by the author.

### Figures {#figures}

Figures include tables, diagrams, charts, and images (but not score excerpts, transcriptions, or video stills, which are treated above).   You can rather easily create these with Google Draw (even marking up some musical example loaded there as a PNG file.

Unless figures are prohibitively large, label them as follows and include them in the body of your essay. Note the use of boldface, and be sure to number figures separately from examples.
