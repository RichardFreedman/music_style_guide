### Audio Examples

* What can you use as an audio example, and how will your reader know where you found it and how to access it?  

* Remember that according to **Fair Use** principles, you need to extract the _minimum_ needed to make your point, and to surround the excerpt with commentary or mark it up in some way.

* **Each example will need to be documented with a caption showing where it came from** (source, track, timing), and **each example will need to be listed along with all your other score and video examples** at the end of your paper.

* Finally, the file for **each example (mp3, mp4) will need to be accessible** for your readers via Gdrive, Box, or in a WordPress site.

* Watch demonstration of software for creating audio examples [here](https://haverford.app.box.com/file/934628633661?s=rx573ab4v3j5yolf6zmu6tnnik371m7f).


There are various ways to obtain and document your examples.

**Option A:  Provide Naxos (or as a last resort Spotify) Link and Timing**

    [Naxos Music Library](https://library.haverford.edu/media/audio.php?id=https://haverford.naxosmusiclibrary.com/advancesearch.asp) is the only approved source of audio examples in a music essay at Haverford. For the sake of accuracy, accessibility, and copyright compliance, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do not use</span> YouTube, Spotify, Amazon, or other alternative services _for repertories covered by Naxos_. 

    If your topic falls outside the realm of classical music, you may discuss possible resources with your professor, and **Spotify** is probably the best choice here.

1. **In Naxos Music Library, navigate to the album you want to use.** Let’s say this is Keith Jarrett’s 1988 recording of Bach’s _Well Tempered Clavier, Book 1_, available there as FEX8082_002
2. **Click the link icon located beneath the play button on the upper right to display the unique URL** of each track, and then copy the unique URL of the track you want to use. Let’s say this is the Fugue in C Major (disc 1, track 2):

    https://Haverford.nml3.naxosmusiclibrary.com/stream.asp?s=34055%2FHaverford18%2FEX8082_002

3. **Add the following prefix to the copied URL**. This ensures that anyone in the Bi-Co can link to your example.

    https://library.haverford.edu/media/audio.php?id= 

4. **Your audio example now has the following full address**: 

    https://library.haverford.edu/media/audio.php?id=https://Haverford.nml3.naxosmusiclibrary.com/stream.asp?s=34055%2FHaverford18%2FEX8082_002

5. **Maintain a working list of your audio examples in a Word or Google document**, including the URLs, the names of performers and works (as reminders), and the timings of the excerpts. When your essay is ready you can then complete the following steps.  
6. **Add a parenthetical reference to the example at the appropriate point in your essay**, **using the URL to make a link**. Be sure to include a time-reference specifying the relevant part of the track, so that your readers can navigate to the right moment.

        Jarrett’s initial presentation of the C-major fugue subject is brisk and legato (Audio Ex. 1, 00:00–00:05). 

7. **Add a citation for this example to the list at the end of your essay**:

        Audio Examples
        Audio Example 1: Johann Sebastian Bach, _The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1_, Keith Jarrett, ECM, 1988, disc 1, track 2, 00:00–00:05.

**Option B:  Make an MP3 Excerpt and Link to it via Gdrive, Box, or WordPress**

Particularly if your example is from a Music Library CD, LP, or other physical recording, you will need to make your own excerpt, store it somewhere accessible, and point your reader (and listener) to it from your paper. This is done in several steps:

1. **Using AudioHijack (Music Library Mac computer) or Reaper (Mac or Windows), record the passage you need**.  
2. **Remember that you must comply with Fair Use principles**, which means taking no more than 10% of any track (and probably much less!).
3. **Also be sure to take note of the source, track, and exact timing of your chosen passage,** which you need for example caption and list!
4. **You will also want to record a short ‘shoulder’ passage** to allow you to make a fade in/out with **Fission** (Mac) or **Reaper** (Windows).
5. **Label the resulting example file **as LASTNAME_CLASS_EX# (e.g., FREEDMAN_229_EX3.jpg). If it’s a still image, your example must be a JPEG, TIFF, or PDF file. If it’s a moving image, your example must be an MP4 file.
6. **If you haven’t already done so for this essay, create an example folder **in Google Drive (HC) or OneDrive (BMC), labeled as LASTNAME_CLASS_EXAMPLES (e.g., FREEDMAN_229_EXAMPLES).
7. If you haven’t already done so,** set your example folder sharing so that anyone with the link may view its contents**.
8. **Upload your audio example file to your example folder**.
9. **Add a parenthetical reference to the example at the appropriate point in your essay**. **Acquire the unique URL of your example file** and turn the parenthetical reference into a link (be sure to include a time reference!):

      The performance of Monteverdi’s “Tornate,” from the Settimo libro di madrigali, by the Concerto Italiano is especially effective in its emphasis of the opening dissonances (Audio Ex 3, 0:00-0:23;[ Listen Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/173MegiokvrvqZNDa2J9tscAsngZea8cA/view?usp=share_link))

10. **If you haven’t already done so, establish a list of examples at the end of your essay.** See the Music Dept. Style Sheet on how to format a audio citation, following note format. 

**List of Audio Example**

        Audio Example 3.  The opening of Claudio Monteverdi’s “Tornato,” from _Il Settimo libro di madrigali_, performed by the Concerto Italiano, Naive OP7365, Track 6, 0:00-0:25.
