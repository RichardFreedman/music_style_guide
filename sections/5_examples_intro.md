### Introduction

To support its thesis, a music research essay references specific evidence in the form of excerpts from scores and recordings.

### Fair Use and Intellectual Property

In the classroom we have wide latitude with respect to what is called the **Fair Use** of copyrighted materials like musical works and their derivatives (printed scores, sound recordings, etc). The same is true of images, films, or other multimedia materials that we might consider the context of the classroom. But particularly as we think about publishing works of criticism, history, and analysis, we must understand Fair Use in order to respect the intellectual property of others.

Fair Use is a complex topic, and there are few hard-and-fast rules about exactly how much of a copyrighted work can be reproduced without obtaining explicit permission. Indeed, the concept of Fair Use hinges on the idea that permission is _not needed _provided scholars do the following:

1. Take from the copyrighted work only the minimum needed to make their point. As a rule this means no more than ten percent of a sound or video recording, only a few measures of printed music, or short excerpts from prose. Song lyrics are a special case, as commercial interests are especially protective of these.
2. Transform the chosen excerpts through the addition of analytical commentary, interpretive diagrams, or other adaptive work that adds intellectual or artistic value.
3. Explicitly Identify the source material in a formal citation. 

Materials published more than one hundred years ago are normally in the public domain and can be used without restriction. Fair Use applies to anything more recent.  

The American Musicological Society has published a more detailed [Fair Use guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOVB9BDb7nCCR9Fqa7OQ3kk9jLxDy5U0/view?usp=sharing). Familiarize yourself with this and be sure to consult your professor or librarian with any questions concerning the use of copyrighted material in your writing.

### The Parts of an Example

An example has three components:

1. A parenthetical _reference_ in the essay. This links the reader to the example itself.
2. The _example_ _itself_, located in your paper (Gdoc or WordPress) in the case of a score, or via some linked repository in the case of audio or video (in Gdrive, Box, or WordPress)
3. A _citation_, located in a list of examples at the end of the essay. 

Examples are numbered consecutively regardless of medium (score, audio, or video).
