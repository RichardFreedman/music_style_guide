### Score Examples

1. **Download a PDF from [IMSLP](https://imslp.org/)**, a free archive of scores mostly in the public domain. With the exception of those flagged as _Non-PD US_, you may use these editions in any way you like. Let's say you're writing about [the first volume of J.S. Bach's Well Tempered Clavier](https://imslp.org/wiki/Das_wohltemperierte_Klavier_I,_BWV_846-869_(Bach,_Johann_Sebastian)). In the case of a well known work like this, there are many printed editions to choose from, even manuscripts. If you have questions, Haverford’s music librarian Guillermo Gómez (ggomez1@haverford.edu) will help you navigate results.

    **If the score you need is not available on IMSLP, get a hard copy from the library**. Guillermo can assist you. He can also advise you on copyright and usage. 

2. **Extract from, crop, and/or convert the PDF** (or scanned image) to include only the necessary content. 
3. **Add your example to your paper or WordPress site**, along with a caption that identifies the item and source:

   <img width="695" alt="screenshot_1360" src="https://github.com/RichardFreedman/music_style_guide/assets/4398776/f8c6d58b-84e0-4d85-a728-325d54b2ad26">

        Example 1.  The opening five measures of Johann Sebastian Bach’s Prelude in C-major, from, _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_, ed. Carl Czerny, vol. 1 (Leipzig: Peters, 1863), 7. 

4. **Add a parenthetical reference to the example at the appropriate point in your essay**:

        The opening of Bach’s Prelude in C-major from _Das Wohltemperierte Klavier_ establishes the home key in only a few bars (Ex. 1).

5. **At the end of your essay, create a list of examples that provides citations**. Format score citations in the same manner as book citations, and use note format here. See the rules for citations elsewhere in this guide.
